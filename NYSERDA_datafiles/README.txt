These .csv files (in directory NYSERDA_datafiles) contain data obtained from the NYSERDA DG/CHP Integrated Data System at http://dg.nyserda.ny.gov/home/index.cfm. The data was downloaded in early June, 2017. The additional directory NYSERDA_select contains a subset of these files that was selected for the quality of its data. Data quality was decided upon subjectively. To get a feel for which sets of data are deemed to be of high enough quality, compare a file that is not in NYSERDA_select with one that is.
